# Star-Citizen-Clan-Org-List
This Python script scrapes Star Citizen organization member data from the RSI website. It collects handles, ranks, join dates, profile URLs, and up to five affiliated organization SIDs per member. The tool supports paginated scraping, saves debug HTML pages, handles errors gracefully, and outputs results to a CSV file.
